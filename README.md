# Multi-modal function optimization with genetic algorithm


## - Problem
Multi-modal functions are functions that have many local maximum and minimum. The main focus of the algorithm is to find the Global minimum value for X1 and X2.

## - Metods 
The algorithm uses some diferent metods to build the GA
- Championship Selection
- BLX-Alpha Crossover
- Mutation
- Elitism


## - Parameters
For the GA were used these parameters: 
- Population size = 50
- Crossover rate = 0.95
- Mutation rate = 0.3
- Generations = 100

## - Results
Selected two cases to show off some results
- With 100 generations
